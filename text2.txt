We built it up and let it all crash down, we had it all and let it burn to the ground. But maybe we can turn around and get back 'cause right now I’m off track. I’m looking for a way back to love, I need you now. I’m feeling for your touch, come back to me like you would, you would if this was a movie. Maybe we’re both just messed up. That’s what’s going on, it’s been way too long, and I need to feel something again. Let me in again.
